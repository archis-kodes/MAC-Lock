# MAC-Lock
MAC Lock is a modified Kensington Lock model that solves the problem of carrying a Physical key by replacing with a PIN to be entered. It also enables the Public Libraries and Cafes to provide Kensington Lock as a secure service again that has been discontinued due to several security threats.
